               <p class="lead">Hello, you probably know my name by now, but it's Isaac Yeung incase you missed it. I am a 15 year old studying in grade 10. I'd say I'm quite a well balanced person in temrs of school life. Unlike others, I prioritise resting over working, which makes me more of a free person compared to some of my classmates. I would also consider myself quite carefree, since I prefer living in the moment rather than fantasizing about the future. As you can see from the image above, I support the football team Arsenal. They play a huge role in my life. I'm pretty sure I've never missed a game since 2019. Other hobbies I have include cooking and K-pop, but I'll go more in depth in the next page. </p>
