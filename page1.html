        <p>Football is my favourite sport. I started playing this sport when I turned 5. To be honest, I enjoy watching more then playing. As mentioned before, my favourite team is Arsenal, a team based in London. I started liking them because the first football kit my father bought me was Arsenal's kit from the 13-14 season. Since then, I became a through and through Arsenal fan. It's fair to say Arsenal's perfomance started becoming dispiriting after I started supporting. I've experinced all the hardships possible and it is close so paying off. As of right now, Arsenal is top of the table, and are only 13 games away from winning their first leauge title since 2004.</p>

        <p>Not only do I watch real football, but my favourtie video game is also a football related one called "FIFA". I created lots of memories with this game, from winning a Champions Leuage in career mode to promoting to division 1 in pro clubs. I just love this game since it acts as a de-stress mechanism while providing a form of entertainment when bored.</P>

      <h2>K-pop</h2>

        <p>Most people are very surprised when they hear that I'm a K-pop fan, mainly because K-pop is not typically associated with big athletic boys. Anyways, I started following K-pop when Covid-19 started, this was all thanks to the BLACKPINK documentary on Netflix. Since then, I've been following multiple groups including BLACKPINK, TWICE etc. The wall in my room is covered by K-pop merchandise, including albums and lightsticks. (photo above) I had the opportunity to watch BLACKPINK live when they visited Hong Kong back in January this year. It was quite an experince, as I finally got to see my idol with my own eyes.</p>

        <p>K-pop plays quite a significant role in me since it's one of my main sources of entertainment. A lot of my peers tell me my K-pop phase will end, but I'm hoping this never ends, since all the spent on K-pop goods will go to waste.</P>
