        <p>It's safe to say football is my favourite sport. I started playing this sport when I turned 5. To be honest, I enjoy watching more then playing. As mentioned before, my favourite team is Arsenal, a team based in London. I started liking them because the first football kit my father bought me was Arsenal's kit from the 13-14 season. Since then, I became a through and through Arsenal fan. It's fair to say Arsenal's perfomance started becoming dispiriting after I started supporting. I've experinced all the hardships possible and it is close so paying off. As of right now, Arsenal is top of the table, and are only 13 games away from winning their first leauge title since 2004.</p>

        <p>Not only do I watch real football, but my favourtie video game is also a football related one called "FIFA". I created lots of memories with this game, from winning a Champions Leuage in career mode to promoting to division 1 in pro clubs. I just love this game since it acts as a de-stress mechanism while providing a form of entertainment when bored.</P>
